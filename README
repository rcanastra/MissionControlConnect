This is a project to enable use of various buttons on a mouse to control Mission Control.

On Mac OS 10.13.1, this seemed to be impossible to do on the usual System Preferences pane. But in 10.13.6, it does seem possible, so I don't use it anymore.

EDIT: Looking back at this a year or two since I wrote it, I forgot what was the actual issue in the System Preferences pane. But from searching online, it looks like you could set Mission Control/Show Desktop/Application Windows to any mouse button, but that it wouldn't actually do anything when you press that mouse button.
