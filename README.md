This is a project to enable use of various buttons on a mouse to control Mission Control.

On Mac OS 10.13.1, this seemed to be impossible to do on the usual System Preferences pane (you could set mouse buttons to perform Mission Control/Show Desktop/Application Windows, but pressing the mouse button wouldn't actually do anything). But in 10.13.6, it is possible, so I don't use it anymore.
